The water cycle is the process by which water is recycled on Earth. It involves the movement of water between the atmosphere, land, and oceans. Water is constantly moving through the cycle, and it is important for life on Earth. The water cycle is driven by the sun's energy and the Earth's gravity. Water evaporates from the surface of the oceans and lakes, and it is transported through the atmosphere. When the water vapor condenses, it falls as precipitation. The water then flows back to the oceans and lakes, where the cycle starts again. The water cycle is an important part of the Earth's hydrological cycle, which is the continuous movement of water between the atmosphere, land, and oceans. The hydrological cycle is important for the maintenance of life on Earth. It provides the water that plants and animals need to survive, and it helps to regulate the Earth's temperature.

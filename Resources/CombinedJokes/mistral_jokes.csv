Create a humorous joke about paranoia.,"Why don't paranoid people trust stairs?

Explanation:

Paranoia is a state of mind characterized by excessive or irrational distrust, suspiciousness, and fear of being harmed. In this joke, we're playing on the double meaning of the word ""stairs."" On one hand, they are a common object found in buildings and homes, used to move from one floor to another. On the other hand, the phrase ""they're always up to something"" implies that stairs might be doing something mischievous or harmful, which is a ridiculous idea. The punchline is the unexpected connection between the two meanings, which creates a humorous surprise and plays on the paranoia theme.</s>", 80% Of paranoid people are completely sane.

Give me a joke about online shopping.,"Why don't secrets like passwords and credit card numbers ship well via online shopping? Because they can't be contained! 

I'll be here all week. Don't forget to tip your waiters and waitresses. 😊

But seriously, online shopping can be a convenient and time-saving way to purchase items, but it's important to remember to keep your personal information secure. Always use a secure website, and never share your password or credit card information with anyone, even if they claim to be from a company or organization. It's also a good idea to regularly check your bank and credit card statements to make sure there are no unauthorized charges. 😊
